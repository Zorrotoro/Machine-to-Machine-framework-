# Machine-to-Machine-framework-
Machine to Machine communication framework using OPC UA (Python Server-Client)

This code contains the desktop framework for estabishing Machine to Machine communication using python. 

It utilises Tkinter and OPC UA framework to develope this windows application.

This framework uses the client instances which can establish an connection with more than two servers at an instant and it can automatically fetch the device tag associated with the servers.



Drawback:
It is developed only to fetch the device tags from namespace syntax for integers i.e. (ns=2;i=##). However, the code can amended based on the users need.
